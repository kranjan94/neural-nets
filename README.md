Neural Networks
===========

This is a Python neural network implementation.

A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that takes loose inspiration from networks of neurons in animals. It consists of a set of nodes interconnected by weighted edges. Each node has a set of inputs from which it computes an output using an activation function. By using complex topologies of nodes and different types of learning schemes and various other parameters, one can use neural networks to perform a variety of learning and classification tasks.

Example usage is shown in example.py, using training and validation data in the examples directory.
